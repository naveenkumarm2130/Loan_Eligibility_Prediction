**Project Summary:** 
Loan Eligibility Prediction - In this project, we are going to develop one such model that can predict whether a person will get his/her loan approved or not by using some of the background information of the applicant like the applicantâ€™s gender, marital status, income, etc. Dataset Size: 981 rows and 13 columns which includes Loan_ID, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, Property_Area & Loan_Status.

**Objective:** 
To develop a predictive model using Exploratory Data Analysis and Supervised learning techniques to determine loan eligibility based on customer data.

**Methodology**:-
Data Collection:
Gathered customer information such as income, credit score, loan amount, employment status, and loan approval status.
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and standardized numerical features.
Model Selection:
Naive Bayes Classifier: Utilized for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling categorical data.
Decision Tree Classifier: Chosen for its interpretability and ability to capture complex decision rules.
Model Training: Split data into training and testing sets, trained models on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Comparison: Compared Naive Bayes and Decision Tree models to determine the best performer.

**Results:**
Naive Bayes Model: Accuracy = 82%
Decision Tree Model: Accuracy = 78%

**Conclusion:**
The Naive Bayes classifier outperformed the Decision Tree classifier in predicting loan eligibility based on the provided customer data. Further optimization and feature engineering may enhance model performance.
